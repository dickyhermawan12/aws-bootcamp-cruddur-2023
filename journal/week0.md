## Getting AWS CLI Working

I was setting up my code environment on my local machine as I am more familiar with it.
My environment is using WSL2 running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Windows 10.
Thus I will provide instructions for Ubuntu Linux.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI via the Ubuntu Linux terminal (zsh).

### Install and Verify AWS CLI

1. I installed the AWS CLI via the [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
  Using the following command:

  ```sh
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip" \
  unzip awscliv2.zip \
  sudo ./aws/install
  ```

  Proof of installation:

2. As I have previously installed the AWS CLI, I ran the following command to update it:

  ```sh
  sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir /usr/local/bin --install-dir /usr/local/aws-cli --update
  ```

3. I then ran the following command to verify the installation:

  ```sh
  aws --version
  ```
